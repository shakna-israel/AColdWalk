## Bugs

If you want to report a problem or bug you've had with *A Cold Walk*, simply open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/shakna-israel/AColdWalk/issues/new).

You might want to check if anyone else has had that problem before.

In your issue, include, in a Markdown codeblock, the results of ```python sysinfo.py```

That'll just help establish what version of *Python* you have, what version of *A Cold Walk* you're using, and what *platform* you're running on (Linux, Windows, Mac).

## Bug-Fixes

If you have a proposed fix for a bug that *has an open issue on GitHub*, then open a *pull request on GitHub*.

Be sure to:

* Include a docstring on any new functions.
* Include a unittest for your new function.
* Don't use classes. For something of this complexity, its not necessary, and would probably make the program slower.
* Don't develop any emotional attachment to your new function.

I've re-written *A Cold Walk* three times from scratch, as I've learned more and more about the idiosyncracies of Python.

## Suggestions

If you have a sugestion for *A Cold Walk*, such as a feature that's missing, or just an idea you've had, then create a new [GitHub Issue](), but:

* Prepend ```[Suggestion] -``` to your issue title.
    * e.g. ```[Suggestion] - Multiple Savefiles```
* Try and describe your suggestion very *clearly*. Try and think how somewhat else might interrupt what you're suggesting.

## Plugins

Though making *A Cold Walk* easily modifiable and pluggable with extensions is on the cards, at the moment, extending it would give you a hell of a time.

Right now, it is not reccommended to even try.
