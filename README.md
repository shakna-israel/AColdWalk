# A Cold Walk

## An Infinite Console-based Game

*The winter is cold, you're all alone in your shack, and you must survive.*

## Features:

* Automatic Saving
    * Your every action will be immediately remembered.
    * *A Cold Walk* saves to ```~/.AColdWalk/save```, which is a JSON file. If you want to cheat, that's the place, but it probably won't help you much.
* Unlimited Play
    * Your resources are limited, but the environment's are not.
* 100% compatible savefiles.
    * If you update your version of *A Cold Walk*, your save will continue to work.
    * A newer savefile *should* work fine in an old version of *A Cold Walk*, however you will probably lose any record of new features immediately.
* Linear Story-line
    * Work-In-Progress
* Random Story Events
    * Not-Yet-Implemented
* Multiple Save Files
    * Not-Yet-Implemented
* UnitTested
    * Not-Yet-Implemented

    * Not yet unittested, but should be accurate.
